# LLM_Flashcard
The LLM Flashcard Generator is a web-based application that leverages Large Language Models (like GPT) to automatically generate educational flashcards from input text (e.g., lecture notes, articles, or PDFs). This tool helps students, educators, and learners quickly review and retain key concepts.
Features

    🔁 Auto-generate flashcards from any input text using LLMs.

    📄 Text and PDF input support (optional).

    📌 Q&A flashcard format (Question → Answer).

    ✅ Edit and approve cards before saving.

    📦 Export flashcards in JSON, CSV, or Anki format.

    🎨 Simple and responsive UI for ease of use.

⚙️ How It Works

    Input: User pastes a paragraph or uploads content.

    Prompting: The app sends the content to an LLM with a prompt like:

        “Extract key question-answer flashcards from this material.”

    Response Parsing: The LLM returns a structured Q&A list.

    Display: Flashcards are shown in a flip-card UI for practice.
